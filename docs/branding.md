# FairHire — Brand Identity

## Brand Essence
**FairHire is a reputation-first work marketplace where trust is measurable and liquidity is instant.**
It strips out slow escrow, middlemen, and guesswork — replacing them with on-chain reputation that actually means something.

> **Core idea:** Your reputation works for you.

## Brand Personality
*   **Credible** — Trust is visible, not promised.
*   **Uncompromising** — No fluff, no fake signals.
*   **Modern** — Crypto-native, but human.
*   **Merit-driven** — Outcomes over credentials.

FairHire should feel like a serious financial system, not a gig app.

## Color System

### Primary
*   **Pure White (`#FFFFFF`)**
    *   *Usage:* Backgrounds, cards, primary text on dark.
    *   *Vibe:* Clarity, transparency, neutrality. Keeps the product breathable.
*   **Midnight Black (`#0A0D10`)**
    *   *Usage:* Structure, deep backgrounds, heavy text.
    *   *Vibe:* Authority and depth. The backbone color.

### Accent
*   **Signal Purple (`#6C3BAA`)**
    *   *Usage:* Primary actions, FairScore highlights, trust confirmations.
    *   *Vibe:* Reputation, identity, action.

> **Rule:** White + Black = stability. Purple = meaning.

## Voice & Tone

*   **Educational, not preachy.**

| **Do** | **Don't** |
| :--- | :--- |

## Visual Direction (Mental Model)
